The proposal document should address the following points. Use these 
points as headers in your document.
Basic Info. The project title, your names, e-mail addresses, CIDs, a 
link to the project repository.
Background and Motivation. Discuss your motivations and reasons 
for choosing this project, especially any background or research 
interests that may have influenced your decision.
Project Objectives. Provide the primary questions you are trying to 
answer with your visualization. What would you like to learn and 
accomplish? Ideally you should have 1 question per visualization 
(i.e., at least 3 questions)
Data. From where and how are you collecting your data? Provide a 
link to your data sources.
Data Processing. Do you expect to do substantial data cleanup? 
What quantities do you plan to derive from your data? How will data
processing be implemented?
Visualization Design. How will you display your data? You are 
expected to create a dashboard with at least 3 visualizations. 
Develop three alternative prototypes for each visualization. 
Describe each prototype using the terminology learned in class. 
Create one final dashboard that incorporates the best of your 
designs and justify your choices (why you picked those among all 
prototypes). All graphs should be created in Tableau when possible.
Must-Have Features. List the features without which you would 
consider your project to be a failure.
Optional Features. List the features which you consider to be nice to
have, but not critical.
Project Schedule. Make sure that you plan your work so that you 
can avoid a big rush right before the final project deadline, and 
delegate different modules and responsibilities among your team 
members. Write this in terms of weekly deadlines.
